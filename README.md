DISCLAIMER: Writing software that captures the screen is perfectly legal. Screen recorders are common (OBS Studio, Snagit, Camtasia, etc.) and are widely distributed. There’s nothing illegal about coding and releasing one — it’s just another utility program. If someone uses it to infringe copyright (e.g., rip YouTube movies), they are responsible, not me.
